 * Hides the admin console behind a secret, hard-to-guess path.
 *
 * The console component physically lives at the internal route `/admin`, but that
 * path is made to 404 for direct requests — so guessing `/admin` gets nothing.
 * The console is reachable ONLY at `/<ADMIN_PANEL_SLUG>`, which this middleware
 * transparently rewrites to `/admin`.
 *
 * `ADMIN_PANEL_SLUG` is a SERVER env var (not `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`), so the real path
 * never ships in the client bundle — set it per-deployment in `.env` on the
 * server. The default below is only a fallback for local dev; override it.
